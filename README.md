# Project Instructions
Follow the instructions here: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/new/pr1/lessons/major-project-brief/

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Notes

> You can use this section of the file to keep notes about your project as you work on it.

1. Trying to create a base structure for my quiz/code. Trying to figure out how I can connect
arrays to buttons and show the buttons dynamically and the questions as well.
2. 2025/03/26 removed some of the code to test more things one step at a time and trying to make it less confusing for myself.
3. ^ Just realized I didn't update this part enough but I used the time-report mostly.
4. 2025-05-19 I finished my presentation today, I felt a bit nervous at first but then I got into it and it felt good. 


> Before the final submission date you should include a "PROJECT SUMMARY" in this section here.

# (My project summary)

1. I just wanted to make a fun quiz that can help someone get better at basic math additions. My original idea was to have random questions but I am happy with this, even though I would love to improve it further.

2. I had a lot of ups and downs while creating this project. I feel like I had a very slow start, even though I started early and I was stuck on several parts during it. (Especially to get a connection between the correct answers and questions with the arrays). Some certain functions were also difficult for me to make. Each time I got one thing working it was very satisfying and I feel like that outweighed the "frustrations" I had when something wasn't working the way I wanted to for a long time. I would have loved for it to be better with more variety but I am happy with the time and effort I've put into it and for the things I have learned on this course. I received some good feedback and it was cool seeing the other students projects too! Some really impressive ones and I will also go to the final presentation day on Thursday.

3. I have a list of things I would have liked to improve if I had more time:
> - A timer for each question to be answered.
> - Write the code more efficiently and cut down on lines of code with for loops for example and other useful ways
> - Randomized click sequence.
> - A specific range that the random number could be between each question/correct answer
> - Make it more fun to look at, different colors etc.
> - More questions in total (I chose not to do this because it would be more 'DRY' code with my structure)

4. Unfortunately I didn't manage to stick to the budget, it was a bit over 40 hours that I spent on it, without counting the time I also spent to test out the new syntaxes from each lesson in smaller programs. I felt that I was stuck on some parts for too long and that cost time. It taught me more things at least.

5. It was a great experience and even though I am not on a high level still, I still love the idea of being able to create our own things.

# User Guide

> Write a clear user guide for how someone should use your program.
1. The user loads the page and sees the text 'Math summations! (For beginners) and below the text there is a visible start button.
2. If the user clicks on the button, the "math quiz" begins and they can proceed to look at the math question and solve it by clicking on the correct button. There are 4 buttons so the user always has 1/4 chance to get it correctly, although, unfortunately I couldn't randomize the click sequence. Would have loved for that to work but I'll work on it for myself.
3. When the user has clicked on the button for the final question, it will output how many correct questions they answered/clicked on and the text is a little different if they guessed all four correctly or no correct answers at all.
4. If the user wants to try it again, they can click on the 'restart' button which appear at the end of the final question.
