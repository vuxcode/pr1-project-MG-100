1. Problem: *I had a problem finding out how to loop through the "questions" and "correctAnswers" arrays. I was trying to do it with == but in the end I found out that using just one = solved it for the moment. And it makes sense assigning the questions to correct answers, instead of comparing them since they are not equal to each other. I'm still thinking if this is the correct approach, but I will continue and make changes along the way. Also, my score counter starts at zero from the first question in the console.log so I will try to solve that as well.*
2. I have some current problems with my program, so I might take a step back and re-do some of the code to understand it better.
