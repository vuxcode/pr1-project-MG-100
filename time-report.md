# Time Report

> Write about what you have done and how long you have worked on each part of the project.

For example: 

- 2022-10-24 18:00 Worked for 1 hour.
  - *List the things you have done.*

- 2025-03-23 15:00 worked for around two hours. List of things I did:
1. Built the base further and plenty of experimenting. Thinking what functions I can make use of and how.
2. Changed some arrays.
3. Added questions to the arrays and correctAnswers.
4. Worked on figuring out how to loop through both.
5. *Trying to think about the next steps on how to turn them into buttons* -
*that works and I also need buttons for incorrect answers.*
6. *Reading through notes again and forgot to log my time yesterday* -
*but I was experimenting for a couple of hours with loops.*




- *2025-03-26 12:30-14:10*
1. *Working on the concept of my code*
2. *Thinking about re-doing some of it to understand it better.*
3. *Reading through notes again.*
*2025-03-26 around 21:30-22:00.*
1. Removed some things in the code to test more things and try to understand it easier/better. Trying different things in smaller steps.
- 25-03-26 22:00-22:15 ish
1. *Trying to use the index variable 0 and using the less than operator for questions.length (0 < 2) and trying to create an output*
- 25-03-26 22:15-22:30
1. *Fiddled with the code for a bit and in the end I managed to create a function that removes the previous question and outputs the next one.*
2. *Improved it a bit more, hopefully going to take this further and try to find out how I can have multiple buttons for EACH question!*




- 25-03-30 16:30-17:15
1. I was busy for some days but during those days I spent a few hours reading notes and watching some video tutorials.
2. *Trying to take the quiz further and figure out how I can connect correct/incorrect answers for each question now.
- 25-03-30 17:15-18:00*
1. *Thinking how I'm gonna put buttons for each question and testing parameter in a function which I think will help assigning correct answers. Reading some of the notes again too.*
- 25-03-30 18:00-18:40
1. *Removed some text in the code and made the first question appear directly. Working on connecting them to buttons.*




- 2025-04-02 12:30-14:00
1. *Spent time changing a few things in the code/experimented and asked for some suggestions.*
- 25-04-02 16:00-19:00
1. *Experimented with the code for a while, read through the notes for the 'Buttons' lesson while working on it.*
2. *Added 4 buttons and IDs to them to start working out and experimenting on how to connect them to questions (answers and correct answers too)*
3. *I moved around my variables/IDs to make the code look better and easier to read for myself and some spacing. It took me a while.*
4. *Thinking about using the 'display properties' to hide the starting button for example once it has been pressed...*
- 25-04-02 19:30 to around 20:00 - *Made a function for hiding the buttons and showing the score for later (if they work properly)*




- 25-04-08 11:30 - 12:10
1. *Had some very busy days but I'm going to put many hours into it today and hopefully make good progress.*
2. *Small changes to begin with. I think about using the Index for answers and correctAnswers and add more functions for it. Also need a way to update the text of the buttons because they are currently static from numnbers 1 to 4 just so they're a bit bigger so I can visualize it easier. I want the "Start quiz" button to disappear after clicking it one time and then that any of the buttons changes to the next question index.*
- 25-04-08 12:50
1. *Forgot to add that I changed the answers array to a nested array.*
- 25-04-08 12:50 - 13:15
1. *I added a 'showButtons' function and when I used that and the 'hideButtons' function at the same time, it made the buttons appear differently at the end. I just wanted to test it and won't keep both functions there.*
2. *Added EventListeners to each button.*
- 25-04-08 13:20-13:43
1. *Tested innerText for buttons and other experimenting.*
- 25-04-08 18:00-18:30
1. *Have some problems with my code now and the buttons, so I might go back to the previous version and work from there, but I think I am starting to get the idea to continue! Experimenting.*



- 2025-04-11 16:15:16:45
1. *Feeling stuck right now on what to do and my buttons are now alligned vertically. I am trying to fix that otherwise I will*
*try to return to the previous version.*
2. *Thinking about making the functions a bit different*



- 2025-04-12 17:00-18:00
1. *I read through some notes, tested different things and changed the name of some functions/element IDs.*
2. *Feel like I am struggling but hope I can make a breakthrough soon that makes it more functional. Watching videos as well for inspiration.*
- 2025-04-12 18:15-18:30
1. *I sort of fixed the issue after changing name of the startQuiz function and IDs along with the start variable.*
2. *Forgot to add that I created a function called "nextQuestion" in the previous version and I want it to work with the buttons after clicking on the start button.*


- 2025-04-15 23:30-00:20
1. Added answers to my buttons (text) using innerText, index variable and the index number for each button.
2. Working on the next function with the parameter "userInput" to track which button was pressed if I can do it correctly. Some progress made!
3. Changed name for a function. Also read some lesson notes.



- 2025-04-22 20:00-21:15
1. I have been busy during Easter and had to prepare for a math test.
2. I spent a couple of hours reading through the notes and built some functions for testing/learning in smaller programs.
3. Spent time reading my code again and trying to decide what to do next and how to make the buttons move to the next question.


- 2025-04-23 around 14:45-15:30
1. *Testing some new things and if I add index++ in the "startQuiz" function it moves to the next question as expected, but then it doesn't track which button was pressed, which makes sense at the moment as the other function "quizQuestions" isn't functioning yet. I think I may have to change the function used for the addEventListener when it does.*
2. *I tried using the function but the scores stays at "1" no matter which button I click.*
3. *Buttons changes name now with innerText so that's good to see.



- 2025-04-28 10:15-10:50
1. *Added "in-line" to the showButtons function with help from Colin. I remembered to use it as well. It fixed the alignment of the buttons*
2. *Got help to use 'div' for the buttons to align them in more of a way that I wanted to from the start.*
2025-04-28 11:00-11:40
1. *Using the 'this' property with innerText to show which button was pressed inside the console.log*



- 2025-05-04 yesterday (2 hours) & today (14:00 to around 15:00)
1. I forgot to log the exact times but I spent close to two hours yesterday and one hour today looking at my code and reading through lesson notes. I did make some changes but I decided to go back to the same version as before.
2. I can see that the 'userClick' variable/parameter is undefined and the 'start quiz' as well since it is outside the function I believe so it isn't assigned to a value or it can't be found inside the function. It also says 'adding one point' for clicking on any button which shouldn't be correct. Working hard on trying to fix it.



- 2025-05-05 06:20-06:45
1. *Changed the 'showQuestion' function name to 'answerClicked' it made more sense to me and I am working on making*
that function work. I can see in the console that when I press start, it shows that index is 1 and when I press any of the four buttons that* *appear after start, it shows index 2 and on the final click it doesn't show me any index number at all. The 'userClick' parameter is still undefined also so I need to assign it somehow while figuring out the index.*
2. Same day from around 07:00-07:40. - *At least in the beginning now, userClic parameter isn't undefined, but it still is for the last button/answer if clicked.*



- 2025-05-06 22:00-23:00
1. I have tried changing a lot of things in both functions, yesterday as well but I forgot to log it. I can see that when I press the start button, the index starts at 0 in the console log. I haven't updated any changes as I haven't gotten any closer but I am trying a lot of different things to hopefully make it work. It still shows "2 correct answers" at the end even when they are false. I am going to the lesson tomorrow and hopefully I can get some guidance.



- 2025-05-07 12:30-13:40
1. Asked Colin about some tips and I seem to be getting closer to making it work.
2. Trying to fix the parameter.



- 2025-05-08 for about an hour and a half, experimenting many things again.
1. *I made a function that shows the questions "showQuestions()"*
2. *Now it only goes to the next question if I click on the correct question and the index seems to be following better! However, console.log(this.innerText) is now showing as undefined on line 71. I will go to the workshop lesson tomorrow as well and ask for some insight/tips from Colin again.*
3. *Updated some comments/documentation to make it clearer to read*

- 2025-05-08 12:30-14:10 (workshop) and for like 30 minutes at home so far.
1. *I added an else statement if the correct question isn't clicked, but it will only go to the next question if I click on the correct one. I tried putting index++ there as well, but then no matter what button I click the total score shows as 0 in the end. Trying to fix it now.*
2. 18:00-19:00 *I tried so many different things but at the moment I feel stuck with it... so I am going back to trying with this version.*

- 2025-05-09 23:00 - 01:30 + another hour or two ish during mid day.
1. *My code is now tracking which button was pressed and if it was correct/incorrect!! I used event in my function parameter 'answerClicked(event) and then assigned userClick to event.target.innerText (property) to track it. I remember that this was showcased shortly in one of the lessons by Colin and I browsed for more information. I was so surprised to finally see it working. I put index++ to increment underneath the if/else statements so it does it either way and called the startQuiz function after that.*
2. I also changed the eventListeners to the answerClicked function for it to work.
3. *I am soooo happy that this is finally working! Spent so many hours getting this part to work!*
4. *Next thing I will try to do is the restart button after the quiz end, for the user to have a chance to try it again. If I can get that working, I will add serious questions/answers to the current placeholders for testing.*



- 2025-05-09 17:15-17:35
1. *I changed some documentation to make it easier to read and also for the presentation*
2. *I created a restartQuiz() function but it's empty right now. I have to study for a math test but I will try my best to continue with it later and during the weekend.*

- 2025-05-11 - around 10-15 minutes
1. (reading through my code/changing some documentation to make it easier for me to read during the presentation and working with the code).
2. Gonna continue working on the restartQuiz function.
3. Added another question, answers on the buttons and a correct answer in the arrays to check that it still works that way.



- 2025-05-12 - Forgot to log. I spent all the time in the workshop working on my restart button & function to work + around 30 minutes at home. Had to study for the math test again as well.
1. I managed to make the restart button appear after clicking on the final button, and after clicking on the restart button, the restart button goes away and the first question begins from the start with the score/correct answers + index set to 0.
2. Continued around midnight, changed some documentation/texts mostly to improve the readability for myself. Thinking about what to add as questions too and I will write them down and then add them to my quiz. Finally added dark mode
