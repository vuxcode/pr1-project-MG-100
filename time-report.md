# Time Report

> Write about what you have done and how long you have worked on each part of the project.

For example: 

- 2022-10-24 18:00 Worked for 1 hour.
  - *List the things you have done.*

- 2025-03-23 15:00 worked for around two hours. List of things I did:
1. Built the base further and plenty of experimenting. Thinking what functions I can make use of and how.
2. Changed some arrays.
3. Added questions to the arrays and correctAnswers.
4. Worked on figuring out how to loop through both.
5. Trying to think about the next steps on how to turn them into buttons -
that works and I also need buttons for incorrect answers.
6. Reading through notes again and forgot to log my time yesterday -
but I was experimenting for a couple of hours with loops and

- 2025-03-26 12:30-14:10
1. Working on the concept of my code
2. Thinking about re-doing some of it to understand it better.
3. Reading through notes again.

2025-03-26 around 21:30-22:00.
1. Removed some things in the code to test more things and try to understand it easier/better. Trying different things in smaller steps.

25-03-26 22:00-22:15 ish
1. Trying to use the index variable 0 and using the less than operator for questions.length (0 < 2) and trying to create an output

25-03-26 22:15-22:30
1. Fiddled with the code for a bit and in the end I managed to create a function that removes the previous question and outputs the next one.
2. Improved it a bit more, hopefully going to take this further and try to find out how I can have multiple buttons for EACH question!

25-03-30 16:30-17:15
1. I was busy for some days but during those days I spent a few hours reading notes and watching some video tutorials.
2. Trying to take the quiz further and figure out how I can connect correct/incorrect answers for each question now.
