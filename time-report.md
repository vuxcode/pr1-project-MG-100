# Time Report

> Write about what you have done and how long you have worked on each part of the project.

For example: 

- 2022-10-24 18:00 Worked for 1 hour.
  - *List the things you have done.*

- 2025-03-23 15:00 worked for around two hours. List of things I did:
1. Built the base further and plenty of experimenting. Thinking what functions I can make use of and how.
2. Changed some arrays.
3. Added questions to the arrays and correctAnswers.
4. Worked on figuring out how to loop through both.
5. Trying to think about the next steps on how to turn them into buttons -
that works and I also need buttons for incorrect answers.
6. Reading through notes again and forgot to log my time yesterday -
but I was experimenting for a couple of hours with loops.




- *2025-03-26 12:30-14:10*
1. Working on the concept of my code
2. Thinking about re-doing some of it to understand it better.
3. Reading through notes again.
*2025-03-26 around 21:30-22:00.*
1. Removed some things in the code to test more things and try to understand it easier/better. Trying different things in smaller steps.
*25-03-26 22:00-22:15* ish
1. Trying to use the index variable 0 and using the less than operator for questions.length (0 < 2) and trying to create an output
*25-03-26 22:15-22:30*
1. Fiddled with the code for a bit and in the end I managed to create a function that removes the previous question and outputs the next one.
2. Improved it a bit more, hopefully going to take this further and try to find out how I can have multiple buttons for EACH question!




- *25-03-30 16:30-17:15*
1. I was busy for some days but during those days I spent a few hours reading notes and watching some video tutorials.
2. Trying to take the quiz further and figure out how I can connect correct/incorrect answers for each question now.
*25-03-30 17:15-18:00*
1. Thinking how I'm gonna put buttons for each question and testing parameter in a function which I think will help assigning correct answers. Reading some of the notes again too.
*25-03-30 18:00-18:40*
1. Removed some text in the code and made the first question appear directly. Working on connecting them to buttons.




- *2025-04-02 12:30-14:00*
1. Spent time changing a few things in the code/experimented and asked for some suggestions.
*25-04-02 16:00-19:00*
1. Experimented with the code for a while, read through the notes for the 'Buttons' lesson while working on it.
2. Added 4 buttons and IDs to them to start working out and experimenting on how to connect them to questions (answers and correct answers too)
3. I moved around my variables/IDs to make the code look better and easier to read for myself and some spacing. It took me a while.
4. Thinking about using the 'display properties' to hide the starting button for example once it has been pressed...
*25-04-02 19:30 to around 20:00* - Made a function for hiding the buttons and showing the score for later (if they work properly)




- *25-04-08 11:30 - 12:10*
1. Had some very busy days but I'm going to put many hours into it today and hopefully make good progress.
2. Small changes to begin with. I think about using the Index for answers and correctAnswers and add more functions for it. Also need a way to update the text of the buttons because they are currently static from numnbers 1 to 4 just so they're a bit bigger so I can visualize it easier. I want the "Start quiz" button to disappear after clicking it one time and then that any of the buttons changes to the next question index.
