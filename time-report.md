# Time Report

> Write about what you have done and how long you have worked on each part of the project.

For example: 

- 2022-10-24 18:00 Worked for 1 hour.
  - *List the things you have done.*

*- 2025-03-23 15:00 worked for around two hours. List of things I did:
1. Built the base further and plenty of experimenting. Thinking what functions I can make use of and how.
2. Changed some arrays.
3. Added questions to the arrays and correctAnswers.
4. Worked on figuring out how to loop through both.
5. Trying to think about the next steps on how to turn them into buttons -
that works and I also need buttons for incorrect answers.
6. Reading through notes again and forgot to log my time yesterday -
but I was experimenting for a couple of hours with loops.*

1. I went to the workshop lesson but forgot to upload my new code to the repository but it's saved on the school computer.
2. I got some help to fix a problem with my for loop, created a button as a test, moved the score++ so it outputs 1.
if the first question is correct instead of 0.
3. Changed a few things in the code at home too quickly and I'm gonna try to get further. Reading notes and experimenting a bit on the side of the main project.

2025-03-25 around 15:00 for a short time
1. I was busy with my other course today, but I thought about using boolean values true/false for my quiz questions.
